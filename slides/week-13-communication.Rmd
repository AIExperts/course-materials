# Presentations {.build}

##

What follows is an example of a bad presentation.

## The "Script" {.build}

**Think about your slides last**

Think about your main message first and outline it

- Start with unambiguous statement of question
- Follow with clear but brief sense of the data
    - What is the unit of observation?
    - List variables?
    - Multiple data sets
- Avoid jargon
- Lay out analytical approach
- Conclude with glimpse of results
- Tell a story but not the whole thing


## The slides {.build}

### Use slides only for things that can't be spoken

- Actually not necessary!
- Also not necessary: your names! (project name is handy though)
- Natural place for data visualization 
    - Use consistent look
    - Revise and revise again to emphasize main story.
- Diagrams/Mock-ups/Schematics/Pseudocode can be powerful.


## Activity

Create a single slide that conveys the structure and context of your data. Things you may want to include:

- Diagram/sketch of the process that generates the data
- Excepted row or two from data set to convey the nature of the observational unit and the variables covered.


## The Presentation {.build}

- Don't face/read slides
- Practice several times
- Be sure to nail first 3 sentences and last 3 sentences
- Consider context of data and audience when shaping your tone
- Stay positive; be careful and constructive

## Navigating a poster session {.build}

**Goal**

Foster *conversation* around your topic.

**Suggestions**

- Encourage their engagement
    - Don't intimidate with a wall of students
    - Allow them time to explore
    - Ask questions
- It may be helpful to restate main Q and data sources
