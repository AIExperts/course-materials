Data Integrity checks:

1. How have the number of people registered changed over time?
2. What is the distribution of ages within the full file? Within OMV?
3. Did anyone register before age 18?
4. Anyone double registered?

Data Exploration:

1. What is the relationship between party identification and voter proportion?
2. Do metro areas have different party breakdown than rural areas?
3. What is the relationship between age and voter participation when controlling for
party?
4. How do those registered by OMV compare to those not registered by OMV?
