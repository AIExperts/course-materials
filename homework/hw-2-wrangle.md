Homework 2: Wrangle
================

### MDSR Exercises

Exercise 4.1 - 4.6. Important note: all references to the `nycflights13` package and its data should be replaced with `pnwflights14`, a very similar package but containing all flights leaving from the Pacific Northwest (SEA, PDX) in 2014.

### Exercise 4.19

Use the `babynames` data set to answer the following question:

*What is the association between the first name the US President and the use of that name as a baby name?*

Address this question with a data visualization. My advice is to break this down into several deliberate (non R) steps:

1.  Start with pencil and paper to sketch out a plot that you think would capture this association well.
2.  Sketch out the rectangular data set that that would be needed to produce it, thinking about which columns you need and what the rows represent.
3.  Write out the data wrangling steps that are needed to get from `babynames` to the data set that is needed for that visualization.
4.  Once you have this pipeline sketched out, turn to R to implement it.

If your visualization would be more informative with the inclusion of outside information, you are encouraging to track down and incorporate other data sets.
